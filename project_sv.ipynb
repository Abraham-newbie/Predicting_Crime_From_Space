    "The first digital archive of nighttime lights taken by satellites established at the National Geophysical Data Center in 1992 contains nighttime data from two satelitte platforms - United States Air Force series of polar-orbiting Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and the current NASA/NOAA SNPP satelliteâ€™s the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS-DNB) (Xi Chen et al., 2019).  <br>\n",
    "The first low-light imagery from DMSP dates back to 1960's, while the dataset availability for VIIRS-DNB covers the period from 2014-01-01 onwards. Some new features of VIIRS lights data have eliminated or reduced the limitations of DMSP-OLS sensor. In a nutshell, the main limitations of DMSP-OLS sensor are the following (Feng-Chi Hsu et al., 2015):\n",
    "* Low radiometric resolution\n",
    "* No on-board calibration\n",
    "* Large spatial resolution\n",
    "* Saturation in urban cores <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To process the satellite imagery, we will be using **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**, which is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis. It is open and free to the public. In addition, GEE provides access to multiple remotel-sensed datasets, including VIIRS-DNB. To pull VIIRS-DNB nighttime light images from GEE, the eath engine snippet [ee.ImageCollection(\"NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG\")](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_VIIRS_DNB_MONTHLY_V1_VCMSLCFG) is used. <br>\n",
    "For interactive mapping with GEE, **geemap** -a python package - is used, as it is not part of the standard Python library, it should be seperately downloaded and installed. Geemap can be used to analyse and visualize datasets available in GEE. <br>\n",
    "To work with satellite data that covers enormous area geospatially, one can work with smaller Area of Interest, that can be either a buffer zone around a latitude-longitude point or a geometry from geopolitical boundary; and then the entire image dataset is clipped into this smaller AOI. <br>\n",
    "If one wants to focus on the geopolitical boundary of a country, then a **shapefile** of the country is used. Shapefile  is a digital vector storage format for storing the geographic location. Geographic features in a shapefile can be represented by points, lines, or polygons (areas).  <br>\n",
    "To import shapefile with geemap, the **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** of the shapefile should be EPSG:4326. CRS basically tells Python how the coordinates inside a shapefile relates to places on Earth. \n",
